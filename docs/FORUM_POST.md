# Forum Post Draft 📬

**Title:** [Project] Open Source Postcard Tracker - Dynamic Maps, Stats & Public Gallery!

**Section:** Elsewhere on the web

---

Hi everyone! 👋

I've been a Postcrosser for a while, and like many of you, I love seeing my postcards travel across the globe. To celebrate this journey, I've built a personal dashboard called **Postcard Tracker** to manage my collection and share it with others.

It's an open-source project built with Laravel/Livewire, and I wanted to share it here in case anyone else finds it useful or wants to build their own!

### ✨ Key Features:
*   🗺️ **Dual Map System**: Automatically uses Google Maps for most of the world and AMap for China (ensuring visitors from China can see the maps too!).
*   📊 **Travel Statistics**: Automatically calculates distances and travel times for every postcard.
*   🖼️ **Digital Gallery**: Keep a digital archive of your postcards and even the stamps you've collected.
*   🌏 **Public Gallery**: A "Tier 1" aesthetic link you can share with friends or put in your profile to show off your recent arrivals.

### 🔗 Explore:
*   **Public Gallery Demo**: [postcrossing.mlintangmz.my.id/gallery](https://postcrossing.mlintangmz.my.id/gallery)
*   **Source Code (GitHub)**: [github.com/mlintangmz2765/postcrossing-tracker](https://github.com/mlintangmz2765/postcrossing-tracker)

### ⚠️ A Note for International Users:
Since I'm building this from Indonesia, some of the internal database columns use Indonesian names, and the default "Home Currency" is set to IDR. However, I’ve included an **[International Usage Guide](https://github.com/mlintangmz2765/postcrossing-tracker/blob/main/docs/INTERNATIONAL.md)** in the repository to help you adapt it to your own local currency and needs!

I’d love to hear your thoughts, or if you have any feature requests to make it more "universal" for the global Postcrossing community.

Happy Postcrossing! 📬✨🥂🚀
